00:00:01,967 --> 00:00:07,967
- You might ask yourself why design patterns are important. I first learned patterns as a means of

2
00:00:07,967 --> 00:00:13,967
- communicating a problem to another developer. You may very well already know how to solve a particular

3
00:00:13,967 --> 00:00:19,967
- problem, and it might follow the structure of a pattern, but it's better to have a common vocabulary that you

4
00:00:19,967 --> 00:00:25,967
- can explain to someone what that problem is. Patterns are an abstract topic.

5
00:00:25,967 --> 00:00:31,967
- It isn't something that you look at the concept and then have it memorized and know how to apply it from there.

6
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:37,967
- Some patterns are more easily applied to particular problems than another, so I suggest revisiting pattern

7
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:45,967
- material as you develop more and more programming experience. Whether it be this course or a book or

8
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:51,967
- something else, it is amazing how your perception of a pattern will change after gaining more experience with it.

9
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:57,967
- You might come away with a different understanding of it after applying it through different coding practices.

10
00:00:57,967 --> 00:01:03,967
- A lot of people have used a singleton and think they have used design patterns, but there's much more than

11
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:08,894
- just a singleton out there.
