1
00:00:01,74 --> 00:00:11,74
- The Gang of Four breaks patterns into three groups. Those groups are Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

2
00:00:11,74 --> 00:00:17,74
- This course is going to focus on patterns classified under the creational group.

3
00:00:17,74 --> 00:00:21,74
- Creational parts are focused on, as you might guess, how objects are created.

4
00:00:21,74 --> 00:00:29,74
- There's a lot more than just replacing the keyword new, though, when talking about creational patterns.

5
00:00:29,74 --> 00:00:41,146
- The two remaining groups, structural and behavioral, are covered in two separate courses much like this one.
