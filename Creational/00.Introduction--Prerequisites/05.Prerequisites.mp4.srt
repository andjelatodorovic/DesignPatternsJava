1
00:00:01,0 --> 00:00:09,921
- The prerequisites for this course are actually quite simple. I am using Java 7, but Java 7 or 8 will work

2
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:15,921
- just fine, and then I'm going to be using Spring STS, which is just a flavor of Eclipse.

3
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:22,921
- Honestly though, this code will work with any IDE out there if you prefer IntelliJ over Eclipse or Spring

4
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:28,921
- STS over Eclipse. Any of them are going to run just fine. You could even run the code in a simple text

5
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:34,921
- editor and compile it on the command line as we don't have a very complex package structure, and it should

6
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:41,500
- work just fine. I like Spring STS because it seems to work and be a little bit more stable than Eclipse,

7
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,344
- but it's really dealer's choice. You can choose to use whatever you want.
